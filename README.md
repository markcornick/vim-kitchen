# Unmaintained

I'm no longer using Vim regularly, and am not updating my various Vim
plugins. Please contact me if you would like to take over maintenance
of any or all of them. Thanks!

# vim-kitchen

This plugin adds a `:Kitchen` command that runs test-kitchen, with tab
completion of subcommands. It is intended to be used with test-kitchen
1.x.

## Installation

With [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) just do:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone https://github.com/markcornick/vim-kitchen.git

If you prefer to use something besides pathogen, go ahead.
